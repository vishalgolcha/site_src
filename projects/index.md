I have worked on projects mainly in the domains at the intersection of image processing , deep learning for computer vision and machine learning , and a few related to the basics of Artificial Intelligence. A few of them are listed below :

## Computer Vision and Image Processing 
 
1. [**Naive methods for Image Similarity checks**](/projects/yrals)
    My summer internship experience with Yrals Digitals , Mumbai .

2. [**Speed Sign Detector**](/projects/speedsign/) 
    A hackathon sans GPUs. Bounding Box predictions for speed signs on Indian Roads.
    
3. [**American Sign Language Recognizer using Hidden Markov Models**](/projects/aslr.html)
    The link will open upto a Jupyter Notebook showcasing the project work on ASL Recognizer using HMMs.
    This project was done in correspondence with a nanodegree course provided by Udacity. The project is an implementation of the Georgia Tech Paper on ASLR and provided a great learning curve for temporal models like HMMs for video sequences and model selection techniques such as AIC, BIC etc.


## Computer Vision and NLP
4. [**A Spin on conventional Image Captioning**](/projects/imgcaption/)
    Hindi Image Captioning with cultural context

## Natural Language Processing
1. [**Script Generation for Simpsons**](https://github.com/vishalgolcha/MoesTavern)
    A classic fun project to generate a scene between Moe Szyslak and Homer Simpson in Moe's Tavern using Long Short Term Memory + Recurrent Neural Networks.

2. [**Statistical Machine Translation**](https://github.com/vishalgolcha/NMT)
    An encoder-decoder based architecture in TensorFlow for translating text between English and French on a small coropora.

## Computational Physics
1. [**Monte Carlo Simulations of Ising Model**](/projects/ising.html)

## Artificial Intelligence
    
Links to be updated soon.

1. **Bayes Net Inference Tool**
     A bayes net inference tool for a given bayes net incorporating the property of markov blankets done as a part of course project in Artifical Intelligence.

2. **Isolation using MiniMax Algorithm and Alpha Beta Pruning**

## Quantum Computation

Links to be updated soon.

1. **Algorithm to Construct the Ground State Wave function by Imaginary Time Propagation Method**
