I am fascinated by the concepts of **Machine learning**, **Deep Learning** and **Computer vision** and have worked on domains intersecting Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I have also worked under the guidance of [Dr. Santanu Choudhary](https://www.ceeri.res.in/director/) Director , CEERI Pilani on a project on Hindi Image Captioning.

I am passionate about algorithms and how we can use them to make our lives better and  really enjoy competitive programming. Offlate i have also been exploring **Quantum computation** and **Multi-Modal Deep Learning** . Over the last three years i have really enjoyed teaching kids in a nearby village called Baas and have been involved in various social activities of an NGO [Nirmaan](http://www.nirmaan.org/) i led during 2016-2017.
